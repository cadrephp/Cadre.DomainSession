# Cadre.DomainSession

Library for tracking session data within the domain (no cookie handling).

## Installation

I do not currently have this package on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).
You can install via composer by specifying the following repository:

```json
{
  "repositories": [{
    "type": "composer",
    "url": "https://packages.cadrephp.com"
  }]
}
```

## Example

See [public/index.php](public/index.php)
